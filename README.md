Homework HTML-Git-CSS

This "Code Refactor" project required cleaning the index and css file.

In the index file:
- Removed extra divs around the site navigation
- Add the alt attributes to the img files
- Removed extra closing tag for the img tag
- Removed extra unused class from the H2 elements in the .content div. 
- Added comments to the html code

In the css file:
- Consolidated the .content and the .benefits elements styles
- Organized the selectors in grouping for easier reading
- Commented the CSS and marked the “start" and the “end" of grouped styles

GITHUB and git
I used the git command to create few commits and pushes of my code to Github
* as bonus had to deal with accidental tracking of a binary file ".Ds_store" from my Mac
* I was able to delete the file on Github by going to the file and deleting it using a trash icon.

After the "code restructuring” the website layout and features are unchanged
