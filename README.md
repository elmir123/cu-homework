This "Code Refactor" project. Required cleaing up the index and css file.

In the index file I: 
- Removed extra elements
- Add the alt attribute to the img files
- Removed extra closing tag for the img tag
- Removed extra unused class from the H2 elements in the .content div. 
- Added commnets to the elements

After adding comments I commited the file to the git hub.

In the css file I:
- Consolidated the .content and the .benefits elements styles
- Orginized the selectors in grouping for easier reading
- Commented the CSS and marked start end end of grouped styles

GITHUB and git
I used the git command to create few commits and pushes to the github of my code
* as bonus had to deal with a binary file from my mac .ds_store
* after searching on the net I was able to delete the file on github by going to the file and deleting it using a trash icon.

The website is unchanged
